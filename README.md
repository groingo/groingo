## About me
### - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently wondering WHY ARE PRORAMMING LANGUAGES SO ANNOYING TO LEARN
### - ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with HOW DO I LEARN PYTHON
### - ðŸ“« How to reach me: They met me in the day of success: and I have
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
to question them further, they made themselves air,
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
all-hailed me â€˜Thane of Cawdor;â€™ by which title,
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
me to the coming on of time, with â€˜Hail, king that
shalt be!â€™ This have I thought good to deliver
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
to thy heart, and farewell.â€™
